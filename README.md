LowEndTalk Deal Finder ⚡  
LowEndTalk Deal Finder is a Chrome Extension designed to help you cut through the noise on the LowEndTalk forums. It provides a powerful dashboard to filter threads, highlight providers, and scroll infinitely, making it easier to find the best hosting deals.

🚀 Features  
- Provider Filter: Instantly hide threads from non-providers. Only see posts from "Patron Providers", "Host Reps", and Administrators.
- Infinite Scroll: Automatically loads the next page of results as you scroll down, creating a seamless browsing experience.
- Keyword Filtering: Type keywords like NVMe, KVM, or USA to show only provider threads that match your criteria.
- Highlight Mode: Keeps all threads visible but highlights Provider posts in Green for easy scanning.
- Hide Quotes: Optional toggle to collapse quoted text blocks, reducing clutter and duplicate reading.
- Batch Loading: "Load Next 10 Pages" button to quickly fetch a massive list of deals at once.
- Persistent Settings: Your preferences (filters, scroll settings, etc.) are saved automatically.
